No lake left behind: How well do US protected areas meet lake conservation targets?
Ian M. McCullough, Nicholas K. Skaff, Patricia A. Soranno, Kendra Spence Cheruvelil

In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity stated that by 2020 "at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water areas, and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes." (Aichi target 11)

# Data
GIS files for ecoregions and US states, input and output data files associated with manuscript
lower48: shapefile of lower 48 states (continental US)
NARS_ecoregions: National Aquatic Resource Survey ecoregions (Herlihy et al. 2008)
NHD: National Hydrography Dataset (NHD plus v2) points (lake centers). Folder titled ArcGIS contains lakes selected by location in ArcGIS that intersect with protected areas (US Protected Areas Database; PADUS v 1.4). Other files were subsets produced in R of protected lakes that occur in strictly protected areas (GAPS 1 and 2) and multi-use areas (GAP 3).
